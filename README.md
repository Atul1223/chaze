#Overview
Chaze is an advanced web3 application reshaping marketing in the decentralized realm. In a landscape where community trust holds immense value, our platform acts as a bridge between creators and users, offering a distinctive, location-based marketing approach.

#Problem Statement
Within the web3 space, traditional marketing approaches often lack the personal touch and community engagement crucial for building trust. Many struggle to authentically connect with their audience in a decentralized manner. Additionally, users face challenges in discovering and engaging with real, location-based opportunities in the crypto space.

#Solution
Chaze tackles these issues by introducing an innovative marketing approach that utilizes location-based interactions between Creators and Chazers. The platform revolves around two primary roles:

#Roles
Creator: Initiates marketing campaigns by dropping NFTs, airdrops, or tokens at various locations on the map.
Chazer: Engages with the platform by discovering and claiming the airdrops, NFTs, or tokens when within a 20m range of the drop location.
Key Features
Location-Based Drops: Creators strategically drop NFTs, airdrops, or tokens across the map, specifying the number of Chazers eligible for each drop.
